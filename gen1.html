			<!-- notes -->
			<ol type="a">
				<li id="noteA"><a href="#cite-noteA">^</a> No baptism record has been located thus far for Richard, but through indirect sources I have attributed him to this family. In 1700, there were two Hockney families in Tetney: Ralph Hockney, and his wife Mary Graves, and William Hockney, and his wife Elizabeth Petch. These two were possibly brothers, and they both had a son in 1700. Ralph had Richard in 1700 and William had Samuel in 1700, therefore Richard could not be the son of William. The only person his father could be is Ralph. Also, through DNA matches, I have a confirmed DNA match at 9 cM who is related to me through Thomas Hockney, a son of Ralph Hockney.</li>
